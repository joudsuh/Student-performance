# Student Academic Performance Prediction using Feature Selection and Multi-Model Machine Learning

This project predicts student academic performance (grade categories) using machine learning techniques and feature selection.

##  Dataset
Kaggle Dataset: *Student Success: Factors & Insights*  
Place the dataset CSV inside the `data/` folder and rename it to:

`student_performance.csv`

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```

##  Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (Best Performer)
- K-Nearest Neighbors

##  Key Findings
Top predictive features:
Attendance, Hours Studied, Previous Scores, Tutoring Sessions, Sleep Hours,
Parental Involvement, Access to Resources, Motivation Level, Family Income, Peer Influence.

SVM achieved the highest performance with full features.
